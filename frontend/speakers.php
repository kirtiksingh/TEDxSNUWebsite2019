                                            <p>
                                                Getting married implies children, at least in India anyway. But what if you aren’t able to conceive despite repeated attempts? Failure to start your own family comes with two things; societal pressure and the sadness at not being able to have children of your own. .
                                                Infertility isn’t a topic that is spoken about in the open, even today, and even in America, says Pradeepa Narayanaswamy, a corporate leadership coach turned fertility mentor. Having been through three miscarriages and several failed IVF attempts over the course of 12 years, this woman is indeed the epitome of strength and is now a source of inspiration to other couples who are going through what she did herself. “I understand that this is a process that people don’t want to talk about or don’t know who to talk to”. Since her infertility journey she has made it her aim to maintain a positive attitude in all situations, irrespective of the outcomes.

                                            <p>

Alim Chandani was born deaf. But this did not stop him from creating a huge din about the rights of the hearing impaired.

                                            <p>

A pioneer in the education of the deaf and in managing and organising events for deaf people, he builds a world where he sees communities co-existing despite their differences. After his Doctorate from the prestigious Gallaudet University, he established the Global Reach Out Initiative. He shifted his efforts to India after joining hands with CentumGRO and now is being funded by Airtel. He also organises an annual quiz, ISL, where teams of people with and without hearing impairment communicate and look for news ways to share ideas. Having worked with governments and global organisations on the education and welfare of the deaf, he has pioneered several campaigns and innovations and is a leading authority in this field.

                                                Because of poor acoustics, students in classrooms miss 50 percent of what their teachers say and patients in hospitals have trouble sleeping because they continually feel stressed. Why does architecture then continue to be primarily a visual-driven exercise?
                                                A concept developer at Saint Gobain ECOPHON, Mr. Manit Ramaiya has been at the forefront of this discussion. A leading voice on psychoacoustics and interior acoustics, he has championed the role of acoustics in the architecture of workplaces to promote efficient designs and better productivity and peace of mind. Being involved with extensive research on the psychological effects of noise, he believes that the need of the hour is to have better indoor acoustics. While architecture keeps getting more and more breath taking visually, indoor acoustics continue to be poor. Through his work, Manit attempts to bring a change in this trend.

                                                Humans are habituated to take from the Earth. The Earth keeps looking out for us by giving us unconditionally, without questions asked and we just keep taking; without looking back at the damage we leave behind in our wake. At what point do we stop and question our habit of taking? The existence of the wildest possibility of giving instead of taking? At what point do we realise that for growing we don’t need to take indiscriminately, but rather need to live sustainably?
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Manisha Lath Gupta, owner of Aananda Permaculture Farms, captures the essence of these questions in her permaculture farms. Starting from Chandigarh and having expanded all the way to Haryana, her farms have grown into ecosystems of their own. Animals co-existing with each other among canopies of fruit laden tress and being surrounded by lush, green crops is the embodiment of the healthy, contamination free life that she always imagined for her family. While her journey to a healthier and eco-friendly life was not easy, realizing that the Earth under her farms hummed with happiness made the journey worthwhile.
                                                Giving back to Earth in spades and making lives around her healthy and happy, join us this 17th November to hear an inspiring tale of agricultural revolutions and of transforming simple dreams to thriving realities.

                                                What’s it like to give everything up? To give everything known, familiar and safe up in the quest of following your passion? What’s it like to step out of the zone of office hours, to reject the 9-5 work life and go on the road less taken? What’s it like to travel across the country without a steady flow of income? What’s it like to step into the unknown, into the dark and stumble along the lines? Most of us are scared to find the answers to such questions, but Abhinav Chandel is certainly not.

Once on the route to become a successful IT engineer, he changed course overnight to follow his passion of travelling. Everywhere he travelled, he took a piece of it in his photography and left a piece of himself there via his writings. Bringing places, cities, people and cultures to life he quickly shot to fame and amassed a fan following of 125k+ followers. Taking the path less travelled he stumbled upon problems; however, he didn’t let it stop him from discovering poetry in the mountains and living the life that we all often dream of.

                                                Is it possible for communities to reinvent themselves in conflict-ridden zones? Can average citizens act when the government fails the people?

Dr. Chingmak Chang has been at the forefront of a revolution in rural Nagaland. Small village pastor turned social entrepreneur, Dr. Chingmak has brought concepts from civil government to the church and the community at large, enriching not only the physical lives of the Naga people, but also their social and political standing. His society has now impacted over 200 villages in Nagaland, and continues to expand its reach. A man shook into action by the horrors of poverty and institutionalised indifference, he has committed his life to making a difference.

                                                How to fix the education system? Our next speaker is on a mission to empower one million teachers who will impact the lives of 40 Cr children by 2022.
                                                Sharath Jeevan, Founder and CEO of STIR Education believes that by helping teachers fall back in love with teaching again, one can come closer to answering the afore-mentioned question. With STIR Education, Sharath has been at the forefront of helping teachers connect with their passion so that they may further inspire a lifelong love of learning in children. Understanding that empowered and motivated teachers are key to educational success, Sharath is building a teacher-led movement for the change of educational practices and systems. The key to this, Sharath says is to re-ignite the 'Intrinsic Motivation' of educators, which he does through local networks of India. He takes teachers from government and affordable private schools through a deep process to innovate, implement, and influence the spread of ideas to address the challenges they face.
                                                Formerly a whiz in the corporate world, and now a leading consultant for several government agencies, Sharath has revolutionised teaching across schools in India, Africa, and Indonesia. Watch him talk about the value of intrinsic motivation and the importance of motivated educators at TEDxShivNadarUniversity, this 17th of November.

            <h2>What is QISSA?</h2>
            <p>
                Stories have the power to inspire, to motivate and to trigger thoughts that can bring about drastic change. Storytelling is one of the most beautiful ways to spread ideas and to spark captivating conversation. That is exactly what we aim to achieve through QISSA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Qissa is an annual event organized by the TEDx Club, Shiv Nadar University. The event is based around the theme of sharing experiences to help spread ideas. It comprises of storytellers who talk to their audience about a wide variety of topics ranging from narratives of life experiences to heavier themes such as drugs, abuse, and betrayal. The whole experience of listening to the story is thoughtfully designed so that the listeners can actually connect with the storyteller. For the same reason, anyone interested to listen to a particular book must register for a slot beforehand. And you'll need to be quick at registering because the audience will be limited to 15 people per story for each time-slot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, in its third edition, QISSA 3.0 is being organized on 3rd October 2018.

                            Travel transforms. It teaches you about life in the most unusual ways. Being in nature's lap, you feel connected, and  that itself is  healing. It makes you value the small things, step forth and  explore out of your comfort zone,  challenging you in different ways, just like life does
                            I found the answers to the questions that kept me up one certain tragic night.
                            Travel is discovey. Question is who discovered who?

Are 6 months in Europe all about solo backpacking trips and pizzas in open cafes and wine in the countryside, or is there a dark side to it too? Does a loss of anchors and identity snowball into something bigger?

We simply have to untag the tags, standing strong like a pillar, fighting our own!

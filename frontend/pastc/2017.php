					<h1>Abhineet Sonkar</h1>
					<p>
						What sets ‘innovators’ like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Joe Gebbia, Marc Randolph etc. apart from others? And why do they succeed in times of uncertainty? Abhineet leads the Innovation & Design Thinking practice for HCL Technologies in Europe & APAC where he is helping companies solve their ‘wicked’ problems and stay relevant. Working with corporations across five continents, Abhineet has realized that in business world one can never really plan for success ~ future belongs to those, who create success.

On 12th November, listen to Abhineet demystify this lie, and share his mantras on how to turbocharge your full-brain potential, and synthesize success.

					<h1>Bianca Ghose</h1>
					<p>
						Everyone has a story. We use stories to give meaning to our lives, to make sense of what we’ve accomplished, and to establish connection with other people. But is your personal story – the one that is meant for the outside world – as simple as the story of you just being you? Bianca Ghose, a corporate storyteller, has spent the last decade working with different forms of storytelling. She shares her experiences – and experiments – with stories and talks about how your personal story, your ‘brand’, is about knowing who you are, what you stand for and then finding authentic but innovative ways to make that visible.

					<h1>Nikheel Aphale</h1>
					<p>
						Why are letters drawn the way they are? What if 'ह' was written as 'स' ? Ever wondered how hard it is to do calligraphy? Nikheel Aphale is passionate about calligraphy and letterforms, especially the Devanagri script. He has designed many book covers for leading publishers from India using calligraphy and handwriting. His calligraphy practice primarily emphasizes on the abstraction of letterforms, which further gets translated into different mediums, be it paintings, logos or products. Nikheel religiously collects matchboxes, vintage stuff, plain-notebooks. “For me calligraphy is a purely spiritual experience. The way my pen, ink, paper and hand interact – is a play of action and reaction. I am not sure of how the stroke is going to end or how ink is going to react on the paper or how the tool is going to help ink form interesting unexpected texture. I enjoy this process of uncertainty, surprises, unplanned exploration more than a final outcome”.

					<h1>Reema Ahmed</h1>
					<p>
						How often do you hear the words “penis” and “vagina”, as opposed to “liver” or “fingernails”? At what age did you learn about ‘birds and bees’? Did you have ‘the talk’, or did you learn about it on your own? Reema Ahmad, Co-founder of Candidly, works towards building an understanding of prevalent attitudes on gender and sexuality as they manifest in media and through culture. In the process, she hopes to raise awareness and question existing stereotypes, without creating an atmosphere of fear, guilt or shame – feelings that are often associated with sexuality, gender and abuse. Reema believes that silence fuels misconception and stereotypes, and the only way forward, is candidly. On 12th November, listen to Reema talk about the miraculous path that lies ahead when you face discomfort head on.

					<h1>Shreya Soni</h1>
					<p>
						In a marketing dominated world, what does it take to run a ‘secret’ organization? Ever receive an anonymous letter/mail inviting you for a meal with like minded people, signed by a ‘Stevie’? The Delhi Secret Supper Club started in 2013 by Shreya Soni with the first anonymous meet-up, where the mission was to get like minded people in one place, and give them the opportunity to connect with each other, with special focus on food, ambience, company and music. The DSSC started off as a secret supper club, and soon became the country’s biggest and coolest secret. After staying anonymous and faceless they came out of the proverbial closet on the organization’s fourth year of existence. Today, they are the leading curators of immersive experiences for the country’s finest and most exclusive member base; along with one of the country’s finest lifestyle guides and exploratory platform for a discerning readership who are curious to know what’s new in the city.

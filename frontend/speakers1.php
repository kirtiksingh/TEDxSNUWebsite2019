																			Where do we go looking for a rapist? What do we do to a rapist once we find him? What causes rape? How can we find a solution to this problem? Is there a solution to this problem? Vasu Primlani is one of the most prominent somatic therapists, who has been notably working with rape victims and rapists. She is also a social entrepreneur, actor, environmentalist, besides being a dedicated triathlete and one of India’s leading stand-up comedians. As a ‘rape prevention and rehabilitation’ specialist, she has dedicated an extensive amount of time and effort to studying the ‘rape epidemic’  which plagues our nation. Out to change a system that is busy educating the victim about how to prevent a crime from happening to her, Vasu Primlani contends that violence breeds violence and the only way to truly prevent rape is to prevent a rapist from being made. On 18th November 2018, hear Ms. Primlani share her learnings and speak to the reality of societal addressal of the problem of rape through rapists.

																		<h1>Harnidh Kaur</h1>
																		<h2>Poetess</h2>
																		<p>
																			"Make magic of my secrets,” she says and leaves everybody astounded with her endearing honesty and courage. A person who urges people to be comfortable in their own skin, her words weaved together possess the power of changing lives.

																			A viral poetess, a validated policy wonk, and a curator of curiosities, Ms. Harnidh Kaur has braved through life with one poem at a time. With two celebrated books under her belt already at the age of 23, Harnidh has turned her social media handles into a haven for voicing her opinions and for people like us to soothe ourselves to the comfort of acceptance.

																			This 18th of November, witness what it is like to lose yourself to the magic of words, the charm of her poetry and let her teach you the art of asking the right questions. </p>

																	<h1>Josy Joseph</h1>
																	<h2>Investigative Journalist</h2>
																	<p>
																		"Some of us will have to stand up and fight and be firm about values. It is when we stand up, that things will change.”- Mr. Josy Joseph. </p>
<p>If you ask around, Investigative journalism is not an easy road to traverse. It requires unparalleled courage and an indomitable spirit, both of which he seems to have in abundance. Former National Security Editor at the Hindu, Editor for special projects at the Times of India, Ramnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Awards awardee, Mr. Joseph has several such accolades to his name. </p>
<p>Be it about the Adarsh Housing society scam of August 2010, the expose about kickbacks in India's telecom Licensing in 2010-11 or the misdeeds during Commonwealth Games, his stories have always fostered greater public debate and have contributed to several significant policy changes.
This 18th November, allow him to enlighten you on why silence of any form is the most harmful thing there is. </p>

																		<h1>Roshni Nadar</h1>
																		<h2>CEO, HCL Enterprise</h2>
																		<p>
																			Moving up in the corporate ladder often makes one focus only on their individual goals, sometimes deliberately ignoring the issues that prevail outside their immediate surroundings. Finding a successful CEO who cares just as much about the welfare of the underprivileged as they do about their business is a rarity. 
For our next speaker, we bring to you one such uniqueness - Ms. Roshni Nadar Malhotra! Having featured in the Forbes list of the world's most powerful women, she sits high in the hierarchy of a $8 billion enterprise - being the CEO and Executive Director of the HCL Corporation and at the same time is the guiding hand behind VidyaGyan - a leadership academy for the meritorious, underprivileged students of rural Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that she is a social entrepreneur and a philanthropist at heart, but her fascination with wildlife is still hidden. Come, hear her out on 18th November 2018.

                                      Two "brothers" (Gabriel and Elias) are informed after their father's death that they both are adopted half-brothers. They discover that their biological father is Evelio Thanatos, a geneticist specialised in stem cell research. To learn about their mother and to meet their biological father, the brothers choose to visit the Island of Ork where they find out that they have three other half-brothers (Franz, Josef and Gregor). Both Gabriel and Elias are welcomed with a beating, but in due course, the brothers get along. All five half-brothers have hare-lips and unattractive facial features or deformities.
